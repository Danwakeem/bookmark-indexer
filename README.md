# Chrome Bookmark Search
This chrome extension is supposed to make searching through your bookmarks both easy and natural. Lots of other bookmark search apps out there want to implement some strange user interface or make you go somewhere else in the chrome settings to search your bookmarks. The idea behind this app is to put bookmark search right where you need it, in the omnibox.
